# Learning Management System (LMS)

A robust full-stack application for managing online courses, student enrollments, and media content.

## 🚀 Context & Goal
This project is being developed as part of my **Software Engineering Internship**. The goal is to bridge the gap between my **MERN Stack** background and **Relational Architecture (Laravel/SQL)**.

This implementation follows the educational curriculum by [PHP Tech Life](https://www.youtube.com/@phptechlife), adapted with additional documentation and code refinements for my own learning process.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Bootstrap, React-Router-Dom
- **Backend:** Laravel 11 (API), Sanctum (Auth)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Tools:** Vite, Postman

## 📅 Progress Log
- **Phase 1 (Frontend):** Completed UI for Home, Course Listing, and Authentication pages.
- **Phase 2 (Backend):** [In Progress] Setting up Migrations and API Endpoints.
